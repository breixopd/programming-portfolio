# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

`Portfolio` Includes some very basic programs as outlined in module

`Personal` Includes other examples made while bored at home or in class (to show off)


## Personal Projects Documentation

Will be putting documentation for the personal programs here divided by headings (program name)


### [Bulk Hash (Python)](https://github.com/breixopd/programming-portfolio/blob/main/Personal/Bulk%20Hash.py)
------
Get hashes of files in directory quickly and easily - this was made for forensics because I didn't want to copy-paste each hash in the terrible program we used
#### Usage:
Enter directory of files you want to check when prompted and choose a hash (supports SHA1, SHA256 and MD5 (more can be added easily))


### [AllInOneAPI (PHP)](https://github.com/breixopd/programming-portfolio/blob/main/Personal/allinoneapi.php)
------
Random API I made in PHP because I had no internet and was bored
#### Usage:
Go to main PHP page with no arguments for usage



### [Admin Panel (PHP)](https://github.com/breixopd/programming-portfolio/blob/main/Personal/Admin%20Panel)
------
Get hashes of files in directory quickly and easily - this was made for forensics because I didn't want to copy-paste each hash in the terrible program we used
#### Usage:
Use `db.sql` to make database (can import file to MySQL workbench or copy-paste if using mysql command-line)
Edit `$db = mysqli_connect("IP", "Username", "Password", "admin_dashboard");` in `server.php` with your database credentials, if database hosted on same server put `localhost` as IP
Will make a `setup.php` page to auto make the database and put credentials in `server.php` file
