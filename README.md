# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

`Portfolio` Includes some very basic programs as outlined in module

`Personal` Includes other examples made while bored at home or in class (to show off)


## Personal Projects Documentation

Will be putting documentation for the personal programs here divided by headings (program name)

### Bulk Hash
------
Get hashes of files in directory quickly and easily - this was made for forensics because I didn't want to copy-paste each hash in the terrible program we used
#### Usage:
Enter directory of files you want to check when prompted and choose a hash (supports SHA1, SHA256 and MD5 (more can be added easily))
